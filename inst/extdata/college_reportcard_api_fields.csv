completion,completion_rate_4yr_150nt,float,C150_4,"Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)","The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate at the institution within 150 percent of normal time, calculated from the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students."

completion,completion_cohort_4yr_150nt,integer,D150_4,Adjusted cohort count for completion rate at four-year institutions (denominator of 150% completion rate),"The number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates used by the institution to calculate completion rate within 150 percent of normal time, included in the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is based on the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who initially enrolled in the fall term (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or any time during the academic year (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar system). Institutions may exclude full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who left the institution due to death, total and permanent disability, active military duty, service in the Peace Corps or other federal foreign aid program, or service on an official church mission (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary/index.asp?searchtype=term&keyword=adjusted+cohort). The entering class used in this metric depends on the level of institution (see ICLEVEL). Four-year institutions use full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who started at the institution 6 years earlier. Less-than-4-year institutions use full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who started at the institution 3 years earlier. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students."
