#' hiRx: Utilities for Higher Expectations' data work
#'

#' wrangling
#'

#' Higher Expectations produces reports that use professionally-chosen fonts
#' and color schemes. These include ...
#'
#' @section Graphical Standards:
#' Higher Expectations' graphs have a consistent look-and-feel. The following
#' functions facilitate making those graphs.
#'
#' @section Wrangling Data:
#' Higher Expectations makes annual summaries of data that come in reasonably
#' consistent formats. Data-wrangling functions capture past efforts to deal
#' with those formats. They are a good place to start when wrangling data from
#' new sources
