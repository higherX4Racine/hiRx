# Race, at least among Racine Students, usually means Black, Latin@, or White.

While folks in town are increasingly likely to identify as multiracial,
there are still a small enough number of them that the only
statistically useful thing to do is to lump everyone else into "All
Other Races." This is obviously bad, but then again, so is all racial
categorization? To add to the perfidy, I'm using the "one drop" system
that is so perniciously part of American racism: you aren't Latin@ if
you are Black, and you're not White if you are Black or Latin@. I am NOT
endorsing this system. It reflects the nature of the community
fragmentation that is in Racine today.
