The vast majority of students in Racine Unified identify with one of
those four racial/ethnic identities. What about folks who identify with
locally less frequent racial categories, such as Asian, Native American,

themselves in is most similar to that of folks who identify as white. As
of 2025, therefore, we will use the following 4 categories when
