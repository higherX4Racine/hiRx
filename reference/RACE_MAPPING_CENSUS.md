# Information for re-coding between Census and Higher Expectations race labels

In Racine County, WI, only a few racial/ethnic groups occur in large
enough numbers for us to report on their demographics. Even though we
lump some groups into an "All Other Races" category, we still value the
cultures and experiences of people from all heritages.

## Usage

``` r
RACE_MAPPING_CENSUS
```

## Format

a tibble with three columns

- SOURCE RACE:

  Labels for each group used by the Census

- Suffix:

  The one-letter code the Census uses to identify tables about each
  group.

- Race/Ethnicity:
