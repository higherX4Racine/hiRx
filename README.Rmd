The goal of hiRx is to collect the functions and constants that are used frequently by data folks at [Higher Expectations for Racine County](www.higherexpectationsracinecounty.org)

## Installation

You can install the development version of hiRx like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("higherX4Racine/hiRx")
```

## Usage

Create plots and documents that feature Higher Expectations' format preferences, such as font and color schemes, graphical themes, and so on.

### BLS Data

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are important for several of the reports that we make at Higher Expectations.

## Example
